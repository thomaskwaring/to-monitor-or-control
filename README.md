# to-monitor-or-control

This repository contains code related to the preprint *When to monitor or control; informed invasive species management using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework*, by [Authors]. 

To reproduce the plots in the manuscript, run `make_plots.py` - further information is given there. Code to compute action-value functions directly is given in `action_value.py`. A full workflow, including parameter settings & instructions on the arguments to these functions, is given in the Jupyter Notebook `vignette`.
